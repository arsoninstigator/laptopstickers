needed to create rough handdrawn doodles to make it a part of my <a href = ""> tutoring project </a> (where i create lesson plans and teach children to code for free) since art sketches give the .ppt a more personal touch and makes the session more interactive (in my opinion).
it is intentionally drawn rough and weird because normal icons on canva all looked ai generated and too common imo
