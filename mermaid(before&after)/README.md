trying out my own brush (importable to ibis paint x) and playing around with it's abilities to color in a different texture (a knitting/crochet esque texture where each "dot" within each pen stroke signifes the completion of one stitch).

can be used by anyone opening up a project on ibis paint > selecting the brush tool > clicking the three dots on the top right side of the panel > selecting "import brush" > uploading qr code from camera roll.

ps. character is not oc and i'm just drawing them based on their appearance as a character on the screen and using them as reference for personal use (no copyright infringement as i will NOT be selling these stickers).
